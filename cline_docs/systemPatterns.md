# System Architecture Patterns

## Overall Architecture
- **Pattern**: Full-stack monolithic Next.js application
- **Reasoning**: Simplifies deployment and development for a demo application
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints using Next.js API routes

## Frontend Patterns
- **Component Structure**: Atomic design with reusable UI components
- **State Management**: React hooks and context for local state
- **Data Flow**: Unidirectional data flow with props and callbacks
- **Styling**: Utility-first CSS with Tailwind

## Backend Patterns
- **API Routes**: Serverless functions via Next.js API routes
- **File Handling**: Multipart form data for image uploads
- **AI Integration**: Abstracted OpenAI client with error handling
- **Data Processing**: Pipeline pattern for image → analysis → generation

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Image Processing Pipeline
```
Upload → Validation → Storage → AI Analysis → SW Generation → Rendering
```

### 2. Mermaid Diagram Generation
- Generate Mermaid syntax from analyzed HW components
- Map hardware interfaces to software modules
- Layer-based architecture (HAL, Drivers, Services, Applications)

### 3. Requirements Management
- Store requirements as structured JSON
- Track changes with version history
- Generate diffs using deep comparison

### 4. Error Handling
- Graceful degradation for AI failures
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry logic for API calls

## Module Organization
```
/components - UI components (presentational)
/lib - Business logic and utilities
/app/api - API endpoints
/types - TypeScript definitions
/public - Static assets
```

## Security Considerations
- API key management via environment variables
- Input validation for uploads
- Rate limiting for API calls
- Sanitization of user inputs
