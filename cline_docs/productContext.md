# HW-to-SW Diagram Converter - Product Context

## Purpose
This application converts hardware block diagrams into software architecture diagrams, bridging the gap between hardware design and software implementation.

## Problem It Solves
- Manual translation of hardware designs to software architectures is time-consuming and error-prone
- Lack of automated tools to generate software requirements from hardware specifications
- Difficulty in visualizing how hardware changes impact software architecture
- Need for testable software requirements derived from hardware components

## How It Works
1. **Input**: Users upload a hardware diagram image (like the iMX6 Dual system provided) along with system requirements
2. **Processing**: GPT-4 Vision analyzes the hardware components and connections
3. **Generation**: System creates:
   - Software architecture diagram in Mermaid format
   - Testable software requirements
   - Module mappings from HW to SW
4. **Modification**: Users can edit requirements and see real-time impact on architecture
5. **Visualization**: Diff highlighting shows what changes when requirements are modified

## Key Value Propositions
- Accelerates software architecture design from hardware specifications
- Ensures consistency between hardware design and software implementation
- Provides traceable requirements from hardware to software
- Enables impact analysis for requirement changes
